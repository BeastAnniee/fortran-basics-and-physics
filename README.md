# Fortran Basics and Physics

This repository contains a collection of Fortran programs to solve basic physics and mathematics problems. The goal is to serve as a reference and practice resource for students and enthusiasts who want to learn Fortran by applying it to classic exercises.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Source code for Fortran programs.
- **bin/**: Executables generated after compilation.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.
- **LICENSE**: Project license.

## Included Examples

- One-dimensional kinematics (rectilinear motion equations).
- Right triangle calculations using trigonometry.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Install [gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/) and make sure it is in your PATH.
2. Use VS Code tasks (`Ctrl+Shift+B`) to compile the open Fortran file. The executable will be saved in the `bin` folder.
3. Run the program from the terminal:
	```powershell
	.\bin\program_name.exe
	```


## Contributions

You can add more programs for physics, mathematics, or basic algorithms. Suggestions and improvements are welcome!
